## [2025-01-01 00:00] | product-grid / product-list
Tension:    V1 nên dùng WooCommerce native blocks hay custom blocks ngay cho product grid/list?
Context:    Planning phase — chưa bắt đầu implement product section
Proposal:   Tạo custom `skvn-marine/product-grid` và `skvn-marine/product-list` block ngay từ đầu
Constraint: Master context khuyến nghị "Start with WooCommerce-native blocks/patterns where possible. Custom product grid/list blocks can be added after the homepage is working."
Severity:   high
Tags:       woocommerce, blocks
Milestone:  V1 / 0.4.0
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-05-18
Decision:   V1 dùng WooCommerce native blocks/patterns cho product grid/list. Custom Product Grid/List hoặc style blocks liên quan để V2.

## [2026-05-26] | quote-flow
Tension:    CF7 ↔ n8n integration method: CF7 webhook trực tiếp hay CF7 send email → n8n catch email?
Context:    Human changed scope again: 0.5.1 focused on page display/sidebar controls; quote UI moved to 0.6.0; CF7 moved after 0.6.0; n8n moved after version 1.0.0.
Proposal:   Do not implement CF7, CFDB7 workflow, or n8n automation in 0.5.1.
Constraint: n8n webhook must remain protected and must not be exposed; no custom-code quote form handler.
Severity:   high
Tags:       quote-flow, php, milestone
Milestone:  V1 / 0.5.1
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-05-26
Decision:   0.5.1 scope was page display/sidebar controls. Quote UI/editor controls moved to 0.6.0. CF7/CFDB7 deferred until after 0.6.0; n8n automation deferred until after version 1.0.0.

## [2026-05-26] | spam-protection
Tension:    Cloudflare Turnstile cho CF7: add ngay V1 hay delay?
Context:    CF7 implementation moved out of 0.5.1.
Proposal:   Do not add Turnstile or CF7 spam configuration in 0.5.1.
Constraint: CF7 form should use dedicated protection when CF7 returns to scope.
Severity:   low
Tags:       quote-flow, spam-protection
Milestone:  V1 / 0.5.1
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-05-26
Decision:   Delay CF7 spam-layer decision until CF7 returns to scope. No Turnstile dependency in 0.5.1.

## [2026-06-02] | quote-flow
Tension:    n8n automation timing during basic CF7/CFDB7 quote form work.
Context:    Human approved moving from tested 0.6.0 to 0.7.0.
Proposal:   Implement only the basic same-site CF7/CFDB7 quote form in 0.7.0.
Constraint: n8n webhook must remain protected and must not be exposed; no custom-code quote form handler.
Severity:   high
Tags:       quote-flow, php, milestone
Milestone:  V1 / 0.7.0
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-06-02
Decision:   0.7.0 scope is basic CF7/CFDB7 quote form. n8n automation remains deferred until after version 1.0.0.

## [2025-01-01 00:00] | slider
Tension:    Slider editor UX: stacked / selected-slide-preview / lightweight carousel?
Context:    Planning phase — slider block chưa implement
Proposal:   Stacked (slides xếp chồng trong editor, Swiper chỉ chạy frontend)
Constraint: "Not fully decided yet. V1 editor view should likely render slides stacked or in a simplified preview."
Severity:   low
Tags:       blocks, slider
Milestone:  V1 / 0.8.0
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-06-03
Decision:   Use stacked/simplified slider preview in the editor. Do not run Swiper autoplay in the editor. Slider sidebar behavior controls may persist as saved attributes, but frontend Swiper runtime remains frontend-only and must respect prefers-reduced-motion.

## [2026-06-08 12:15] | blocks
Tension:    Add Feature Showcase block during 1.2.1 even though milestone scope names exactly three Slider presets.
Context:    Human approved naming artifact-inspired expanding accordion/gallery as "Feature Showcase" and wants the mobile split state used intentionally.
Proposal:   Implement a conservative `skvn-marine/feature-showcase` block that reuses plugin-owned CSS, no Tailwind CDN, no new dependency, and leaves existing Accordion unchanged.
Constraint: 1.2.1 planning says "Implement exactly three inserter-facing presets in 1.2.1" and non-scope excludes extra slider experiences.
Severity:   low
Tags:       blocks, slider, editor-governance
Milestone:  V1 / 1.2.1
Status:     ARCHIVED
Resolved:   2026-06-08
Decision:   Park Feature Showcase source for V1 / 1.2.3. During 1.2.1, keep the source unregistered, keep it out of the inserter, and document the future milestone before activation.
